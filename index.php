                <br />Thank you for using my Orange Reviews website!
            </p>

                Here you will be able to search food reviews by dish name, location, meal-time, rating and by vegetarian dishes. Please use the sidebar on the left to search for dishes. While creating this outcome, I didn't focus very much on the visual appeal of the front-end interface, as it's only a tool to display the content of my database and wasn't as essential as completing my queries correctly.

                There is currently no feedback form for this website, though chances are you are viewing this website per my request or to mark it as a teacher. Either way I'd love for you to get back to me with feedback (which I'm sure you'll have plenty of) on how to improve my website interface/data processing via my school email - unavailable here for security precautions.
